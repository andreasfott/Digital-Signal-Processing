Description:
This project simulates a system for detecting telephone touch tones (DTMF signals) using Python. It demonstrates how the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) is applied to identify dual-tone multi-frequency (DTMF) signals generated by telephone keypads. The project includes generating tones for each keypad button and decoding a sequence of tones from a recorded audio file. The second part of the project focuses on short-time audio analysis, including calculations of short-time energy, zero-crossing rate, spectral centroid, and spectral flux on both speech and music signals. This analysis aids in distinguishing between voiced and unvoiced sounds, speech pauses, and transitions in music.

Key Features:
DTMF tone generation and decoding
Short-time Fourier transform (STFT) analysis of audio signals
Calculation of short-time energy, zero-crossing rate, spectral centroid, and spectral flux
Visualizations of speech and music features for audio classification and analysis
